              <h2>Join for the Tracking, stay for the Community</h2>
              <p>Turn your smartphone into a Flight Data Recorder and register GPS data, G’s, % RPM... Share your track with whoever you want in real time. Your family, friends and even your flight instructor will track you live. Moreover, AVIAZE automatically detects events such as the starting of the engine, the takeoff and landings among others. At the end of each flight a Post Flight Report will be provided with the calculated engine time, block time and airborne time, as well as performance charts and the detailed track. Your ultimate resource for good debriefing </p>
              <p>There is no connection or interface between the aircraft and your smartphone. You just need to have a minimum battery level and place the smartphone in a spot with good visibility towards the sky to enhance GPS reception. AVIAZE collects the information from the sensors on your device. </p>
              <p>Pilots are the heart and soul of AVIAZE and our community the cornerstone of the whole AVIAZE experience. Follow your pilot friends, share your tracking, get inspired for your next x-country, drop comments, receive likes and above all enjoy, you are a pilot and #pilotsareawesome. </p>
